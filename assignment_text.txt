 🧩  Programming Assignment: Outbound Voice Campaign 
 Microservice 
 Problem Overview 
 You are tasked with enhancing an existing microservice that currently provides: 
 1.  An API to  trigger an outbound voice call  , and 
 2.  An API to  check the status  of a call (  in_progress  ,  completed  , or  failed  ). 
 Your goal is to extend this system to support  outbound  call campaigns  — allowing multiple 
 calls to be triggered and managed together under a single campaign. 
 Requirements 
 The enhanced system should enable management of  outbound  call campaigns  , where 
 multiple calls can be triggered and monitored together under a single campaign. The following 
 capabilities are expected to be supported: 
 1. Campaign Management 
 ●  The system should allow clients to  create and manage  outbound call campaigns  . 
 ●  Each campaign should contain a group of phone numbers that need to be called. 
 ●  Campaigns should maintain their own lifecycle and track the progress and results of all 
 calls within them. 
 2. Business Hour Scheduling 
 ●  Campaigns should support defining  specific business  hours  during which calls can be 
 made. 
 ●  Calls should be automatically scheduled and executed only within these configured time 
 windows. 
 ●  The system should be able to handle different time zones and prevent calls from being 
 triggered outside allowed hours. 
 3. Concurrency Control 
 ●  The system should allow configuration of  maximum concurrent  calls  that can be active 
 at a time within a campaign. 
 ●  If no value is specified, the system should apply a  default concurrency limit  . 
 4. Retry Handling 
 ●  If a call attempt fails, the system should  automatically  retry  the call based on the 
 campaign’s retry configuration. 
 ●  The system should ensure that failed calls are retried before new calls are initiated, 
 maintaining fairness and efficiency. 
 5. Status Tracking 
 ●  The system should track and expose the  status of individual  calls  (e.g., in-progress, 
 completed, failed) and the  overall campaign status  (e.g., pending, in-progress, 
 completed, failed). 
 ●  Campaigns should provide aggregated statistics such as total calls, calls completed, 
 calls failed, and retries attempted. 
 System Design Requirements 
 Apart from the code that implements the above requirements, you must include a  high-level 
 architecture diagram  or  text-based explanation  describing: 
 ●  How APIs, databases, and background workers interact to meet the above capabilities 
 ●  The choice of technology for these  external components  (e.g., message queues like 
 RabbitMQ, databases like PostgreSQL, task schedulers like Celery, etc.) 
 ●  How the system ensures  fault tolerance  and  scalability  . 
 Implementation Expectations 
 ●  You may use  any programming language or framework  (Python, Go, Node.js, Java, 
 etc.) 
 ●  Code must be  production-quality  , readable, and modular. 
 ●  Include clear instructions for how to: 
 ○  Set up and run the service locally 
 ○  Run sample tests or curl commands 
 ●  Include  mock implementations  for outbound call triggering  (no need for real telephony 
 integration). 
 Deliverables 
 Candidates should submit: 
 1.  Source code (in a Git repo or zip file) 
 2.  README file with: 
 ○  Setup instructions 
 ○  Example API usage 
 ○  System design explanation 
 3.  (Optional) Diagrams or flowcharts for the system design
